## Hi there!

My name is Dan Bartley. I am a PhD student in ecohydrology studying agricultural soil health. I am interested in land surface modelling, and my work explores the interactions between climate, hydrology and management practices to support sustainable farming. Prior to my PhD project, I completed an MPhil research degree in physical oceanography, and also hold an MEng degree in civil engineering.
