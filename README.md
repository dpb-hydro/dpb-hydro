## Hi there!

My name is Dan Bartley. I am a PhD student in ecohydrology with a focus on agricultural soil health. I am interested in Earth system modelling, and my work explores the interactions between climate, hydrology, and management practices to support sustainable farming. Prior to my PhD project, I completed an MPhil research project investigating ocean flow using computer modelling, and also hold an MEng degree in Civil Engineering.
